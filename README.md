# Online Shop Application

This is a full-stack online shop platform consisting of:

- **Frontend** – React-based customer interface
- **Backend** – Node.js + Express API server with MongoDB
- **Admin Panel** – Admin dashboard to manage products

---

# Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (for running MongoDB locally)

---

# Running the application locally

- Clone the repository
- Ensure prerequisites are installed
- Allow the script `runApp.sh` to execute
```
chmod +x runApp.sh
```
- Run the script 
```
./runApp.sh
```
- By default, the frontend and admin panel will start up automatically at port 3000 and 3001 respectively. Both will open in two separate browser tabs.
